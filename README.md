# Customer-Churn-Prediction
Customer Churn Prediction in a firm.
<br>
This project aims to predict whether a customer will churn or not based on historical data. It involves extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and compares several machine learning models to find the most accurate predictor. After evaluating models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN, and Support Vector Classifier (SVC) — SVC was found to perform the best.

Features: Customer demographics, account information, services signed up for, tenure, charges, and more.

Target: Churn — whether the customer left the company (Yes/No)
